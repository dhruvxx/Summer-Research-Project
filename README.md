# Summer-Research-Project
This is a mini summer research project focussing on events that led to the shift from the second to the third wave of feminism. Along with events, popular culture like books and movies are also analyzed.

The following movies are part of this project: <br />
- Gone with the wind (1939),
- The Apartment (1959), and
- Tootsie (1982)

Please note, this project was done in my first year to get a greater level of insight on how research works and hence my analysis of the above mentioned movies are based on my then understanding of research and literary analysis.
